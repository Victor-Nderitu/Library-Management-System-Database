Library Management System
Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Library Management System database designed to handle books, members, loans, reservations, and fines. The system supports multiple authors per book, tracks inventory, and manages member relationships.

Prerequisites
MySQL Server (8.0 or higher recommended)

MySQL Workbench or command-line MySQL client

Installation Instructions
1. Download the SQL Script
Clone or download the library_management_system.sql file from this repository.

2. Set Up MySQL Database
Start your MySQL server

Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client

Connect to your MySQL instance

3. Execute the SQL Script
Using MySQL Workbench:
Open the SQL script file in MySQL Workbench

Click the lightning bolt icon to execute the entire script

Alternatively, execute statements one by one

Using Command Line:
bash
mysql -u your_username -p < library_management_system.sql
4. Verify the Database Creation
After execution, verify that the database and tables were created successfully:

sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE library_management_system;
SHOW TABLES;
Database Structure
The database consists of the following tables:

members - Library member information

authors - Book authors

publishers - Book publishers

categories - Book categories/genres

books - Book information

book_authors - Many-to-many relationship between books and authors

loans - Book borrowing records

reservations - Book reservation records

fines - Fine records for overdue books
Maintenance
Regularly back up the database using MySQL dump utilities

Monitor table sizes and consider archiving old records

Review and optimize indexes as the database grows

Troubleshooting
If you encounter permission errors, ensure your MySQL user has privileges to create databases

If tables don't create properly, check for syntax errors in the SQL script

Verify that your MySQL version supports all used features (especially if using an older version)
